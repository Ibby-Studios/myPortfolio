            <h1>Ibby Studios</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my world of creativity and innovation! My name is Ibrahim Ahmad, and I am the proud owner of Ibby Studios, where I lead the charge in crafting immersive gaming experiences. With a passion for storytelling and interactive design,
                I specialize in merging cutting-edge technology with rich narratives to create games that captivate players and push the boundaries of imagination.
                <br><br> My journey in technology and game development has been shaped by years of dedication to learning and exploration. With a BS in Informatics from Indiana University, where I also minored in Game Design/Development and Classical
                Studies, I’ve honed my skills in game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Beyond technical expertise, my academic and professional achievements include leading dynamic teams, developing intricate 3D environments, and mentoring
                budding developers—all while making a mark as a researcher, producer, and developer.
                <br> <br>At Ibby Studios, my goal is to inspire and engage through the art of game design. Whether it’s building complex game mechanics or fostering immersive storytelling, I thrive on challenges that spark creativity and deliver unique
                experiences. Join me in exploring a world where technology meets artistry, and let’s create something extraordinary together!</p>
